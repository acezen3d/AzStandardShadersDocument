## Additional property description
### UseCustomMainLight 
Whether to use the custom main light.

**Value: false**
- Use the main light in the scene; if unavailable, fall back to the custom main light.

**Value: true**
- Always use the custom main light defined by `CustomMainLightDirection` and `CustomMainLightColor`, regardless of the main light in the scene.

The custom main light settings (`CustomMainLightDirection` and `CustomMainLightColor`) are inspired by and optimized from the so-called built-in main light in Unity Toon Shader, enabling users to define their own custom main light. This `UseCustomMainLight` switch allows features to ignore the main light in the scene and use the custom main light instead, preventing unwanted lighting jumps caused by the switching of the main light during light animations. Further explanation is not provided here due to text limitations.

Whether it's the main light in the scene or the custom main light, both are used for light blending and masking in features.

### CustomMainLightDirection
The definition of the custom main light direction follows Unity‚Äôs convention, with the initial direction along the negative z-axis and a rotation defined by ZXY-ordered Euler angles in units of $\pi$.
- `red`: X-axis rotation.
- `green`: Y-axis rotation.
- `blue`: Z-axis rotation.
- `alpha`: not used.

### RimLightPower, RimLightScale and RimLightBias
The Fresnel effect of the rim light is given by the following well known formula:

$$RimLightFresnel = RimLightBias + RimLightScale * (base)^{RimLightPower}$$

### RimLightMode
Used to determine what the $base$ is in the above formula, mainly involving how to handle back faces.

**Value: 0**
- Rim light can not be applied to back faces, which is useful for transparent rendering.

**Value: 1**
- Rim light can be applied to back faces, which is useful for non-transparent rendering and when using the rim light static rotation.

### RimLightRotation
Rim light static rotation. The rim light rotates in view space, following ZXY-ordered Euler angles in units of $\pi$.
- `red`: X-axis rotation.
- `green`: Y-axis rotation.
- `blue`: Z-axis rotation.
- `alpha`: Not used.

### MainLightToRimLight
- `red`: Blends the main light to the rim light. Value range: $[0,1]$.
- `green`: The power of Half Lambert to determine the range for blending the main light to the rim light. Value range: $[0,\infty)$, typically $[0,10]$.
- `blue`: Applies the mask based on the main light direction to the rim light. Value range: $[-1,1]$. Negative values will invert the mask.
- `alpha`: The power of Half Lambert to determine the range for masking the rim light. Value range: $[0,\infty)$, typically $[0,10]$.

### MatcapUVMethod
Controls the generation of the Matcap UVs, thus affecting the sampling of the matcap textures.

**Value: 0**
- ***Orthographic***. This is the most conventional sampling, but it will have problems such as edge distortion. 

**Value: 1**
- ***Spherical Reflection***. The reflection direction is calculated first in the perspective view, and the normal direction is calculated again in the orthogonal view.

**Value: 2**
- ***Constructing Projection***. Three.js's approach. Using the upward positive y-axis of the camera, construct the tangent and binormal to project onto the view space normal direction.

**Value: 3**
- ***Cross Product***. Simple construction of the cross product of the normal and the view vectors.

**Value: 4**
- ***RNM Blending***. Perturbation of the view space normal direction using the RNM normal blending. Unity Toon Shader's approach.

### MainLightToMatcap
- `red`: Blends the main light to the matcap. Value range: $[0,1]$.  
- `green`: The power of Half Lambert to determine the range for blending the main light to the matcap. Value range: $[0,\infty)$, typically $[0,10]$.
- `blue`: Applies the mask based on the main light direction to the matcap. Value range: $[-1,1]$. Negative values will invert the mask.
- `alpha`: The power of Half Lambert to determine the range for masking the matcap. Value range: $[0,\infty)$, typically $[0,10]$.

## Notes
- Materials using `Az/StandardExtraStyle` generally cannot exist independently; it is merely an overlay, providing additional stylized rendering, just as its name suggests. Therefore, you first need a base material, such as one using other Az Standard shaders, and then apply `Az/StandardExtraStyle` by duplicating the material. Also make sure that `RenderQueue` is set higher than the base material.
- However, duplicating materials in Unity has its limitations. In Unity, a sub-mesh can have only one material (a one-to-one relationship), and any additional materials will be applied to the last sub-mesh. Therefore, when a mesh has multiple sub-meshes, extra caution is needed, as the material may not be successfully applied to the earlier sub-meshes.
- The rim light in `Az/StandardExtraStyle` supports both static rotation and main light masking, and they can coexist without any conflicts. (Unlike other shaders in Koikatsu with rim light,) it remains stable and does not exhibit unpredictable changes due to variations in the camera's viewpoint, thus ensuring a truly static and correct rotation.
- The offset and tiling of `MatcapTex(2)` are useful, allowing adjustments to the matcap textures. The offset controls the position shift, while the tiling scales the texture around its center (so the tiling works like `Tweak_MatCapUV` in Unity Toon Shader).
